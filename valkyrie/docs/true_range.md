# True Range

A true range (TR) measures market volitility of each tick using the high, low, and yesterday's close. This indicator is often used as a predecessor for a simple moving average.

* Large TR = higher volitility

* Lowver TR = lower volitility

### Formula

$TR = Max[Abs(H - C_p), Abs(L - C_p), (H - L)]$

$H$ = High

$L$ = Low

$C_p$ = Previous Close

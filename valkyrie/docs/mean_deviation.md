# Mean Deviation

The mean deviation (MD) measures the average absolute difference each value is from the period's mean.

* Large MD = higher volitility

* Lower MD = lower volitility


### Formula

$MD = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} abs(x_i - \mu)}{N}$

__Where:__

$N$ = Lookback Period

$x_i$ = Value at tick $i$

$\mu$ = mean of period

# Mean Deviation (MD)

The mean deviation measures the average absolute difference each value is from the period's mean. [Learn More](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/mean-deviation.html)

* Large MD = higher volitility

* Lower MD = lower volitility


## Formula

$MD = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} abs(x_i - \mu)}{N}$

* $N$ = Lookback Period

* $x_i$ = Value at tick $i$

* $\mu$ = mean of period

_Note the mean deviation is performed in parallel to an 8 period SMA for comparison._

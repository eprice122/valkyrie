# Average True Range

An average true range (ATR) measures the average market volitility of each tick using the high, low, and yesterday's close.

* Large TR = higher volitility

* Lower TR = lower volitility

### Formula

$ATR = (\frac{1}{n}$) $\sum_{i=1}^{n} TR_i$	

$TR = Max[Abs(H - C_p), Abs(L - C_p), (H - L)]$

$H$ = High

$L$ = Low

$C_p$ = Previous Close

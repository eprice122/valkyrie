# Commodity Channel Index

The commodity channel index (CCI) compares the current price to the average price of a given period. It is used to identify cyclical turns of equities and beginnings of new trends.


### Formula

$CCI = \frac{TP - SMA}{0.015 * MD}$

$TP$ = Typical Price

$SMA$ = Simple Moving Average - 20 period

$MD$ = Mean Deviation
